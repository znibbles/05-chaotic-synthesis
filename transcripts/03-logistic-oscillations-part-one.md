Do you know this plot? This is the _logistic map_, it is used to model the development (reproduction and starvation, that is) of populations in biological systems. But it is most significantly known for its archetypal display of how chaotic behaviour can arise from totally deterministic, but non-linear dynamic equations.

The logistic map is written $x_{n+1} = rx_{n}(1-x_{n})$, the two feedforward terms denoting reproduction and starvation, cancelling each other and preventing overflow, and thus clipping. The significant parameter is $r$, which is plotted from 2.4 to 4.0 in the previous plot. Depending on it, the output sequence tends to either converge towards one value, as when $r$ is below 3, or oscillate between two or more values, as between 3 and 3.567, or display chaotic behaviour, above that.

What is very characteristic of this function is that it even after the onset of chaos, there are intermittent sections exhibiting oscillating attractors. It is exactly this behaviour which makes it very interesting for sound synthesis.
